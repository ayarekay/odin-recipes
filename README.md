This is the first website I've built completely on my own. 
It's a recipe website! It ain't much, but it's honest work.
It includes my 3 favorite recipes, the ones I meal prep on a regular basis. 
There's a homepage with a brief description of each recipe. Each description includes links to the full recipe breakdown
Each recipe instruction page includes a picture of the finished product and step-by-step instructions. 
Boy, basic HTML is ugly!!!
