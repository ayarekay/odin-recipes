        <h1>Silly Chili</h1>
            <p>It don't get too cold down here in the South, but that sure as shoot don't mean I can't eat this chili. It's so darn good! The only kicker is that it's got them magic beans in it. Your partner may want to steer clear of your rear for a few hours after slammin this stew. Ever heard of a dutch oven? </p>
