            <p>There's nothin' a workin' man wants more than some steak and potatoes after a hard day's work. I ain't got no taters for ya, but I do have the chuckeye steak recipe of a lifetime. It only takes 4 ingredients and an oven. Tasty enough to tame your temper, simple enough to settle your soul.  </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1lb ribeye</li>
                    <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
                    <li>1tsp salt</li>
                </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set oven to broil. Let it heat up for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Put steak on baking trey and coat both sides evenly with garlic powder, pepper, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Once oven is heated up, put steak trey inside on a rack. The rack should be about 6 inches from broiler.</li>
                    <li>Broil for 5 minutes on one side, then flip. Broil for another 5 minutes on the opposite side.</li>
                    <li>Take steak out of the oven. Cover for 5 minutes and let rest. Serve.</li>
                </ol>
